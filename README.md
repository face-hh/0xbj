# This is a virus. Do not run it on your main machine. Use a virtual machine.

## How to run
### Pre-built
1. Download the `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/face-hh/0xbj/releases) tab.
2. Unzip it, you will find `Virus` and `GTA6.exe`.
3. Run `GTA6.exe`
### Compile
1. Download the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).
2. Run the instructions in the `Virus/` folder to compile to a `main.exe`. **NOTE: Most scripts require assets, that are not present on the repo because they're too big. (`.mp4`, `.jpg`, etc.)**
3. Open the Godot engine, click `Import` and select this folder.

Note:
- It may take some time for the game to verify if the virus is present.
- The resolution of the screen must be 1920x1080.
- You can easily close the program by pressing `Win` and right-click `Close` on GTA6. Or simply restart your computer.
- **Play with sound!**
